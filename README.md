# Chapter 2 : Lets try with objects

In this chapter, I was looking use objects into my program.ts. Instead of hardly shown "Hello world" in the output console, like I have done in the first Chapter, now I decided to create an object class named "Message" which got two attributes: firstpart and secondepart.
the first part of our message will be "Hello" and the second one will be "world". This class will also have five methods:
two, to set the different parts, two others to get this to parts and the last one to get the entire message.

This chapter allowed me to handle those notions:

* Import and export modules
* Objects classes creation
